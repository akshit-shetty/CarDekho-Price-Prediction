CarDekho Linear Regression Model ðŸš—ðŸ“ˆ

Welcome to the CarDekho Linear Regression Model GitHub repository! In this project, we aim to predict the selling prices of cars using the CarDekho dataset, which comprises essential details like car name, year, present price, kilometers driven, and more. The dataset contains information on approximately 301 cars sold by CarDekho, providing a comprehensive set of features, including fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner details.

The tasks within this project span various activities, starting with reading and loading the dataset, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure data quality and handle missing values. We then transform categorical data to make it suitable for the multiple linear regression model. The model's application comes next, with a thorough examination of the results and an exploration of feature importance.

Success in this case study is determined by achieving R-squared and Adjusted R-squared scores both exceeding 0.8, signifying the effectiveness of the predictive model. You can navigate and understand the project by cloning this repository to your local machine and executing the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script. Dive into the analysis, model results, and diagnostic plots to uncover insights into predicting car selling prices. ðŸš—ðŸ“ˆ
